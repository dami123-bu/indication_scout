# IndicationScout

An agentic system for discovering drug repurposing opportunities.

## Overview

IndicationScout is an agentic drug repurposing system. A drug name goes in; coordinated AI agents query multiple biomedical data sources and produce a repurposing report.

A **Supervisor** agent orchestrates three specialist sub-agents:

- **Literature agent** — Queries PubMed via EUtils, then runs a RAG pipeline: fetch abstracts, embed with BioLORD-2023, semantic search, and LLM-based synthesis of evidence for each candidate disease.
- **Clinical Trials agent** — Queries ClinicalTrials.gov v2 (REST) per drug × indication pair: all-status search (whitespace verdict + per-status counts), completed-trial query (with Phase 3 count), terminated-trial query (with `why_stopped` text classified into safety / efficacy / business / enrollment categories at the tool layer), competitive landscape for the indication, and an FDA-label approval check used to short-circuit when the drug is already approved for the candidate. Indications are resolved to a MeSH descriptor via NCBI E-utilities and the resolved preferred term is fed to CT.gov's server-side `AREA[ConditionMeshTerm]"<term>"` filter — so e.g. "hypertension" trials aren't mixed in with glaucoma/portal/pulmonary hypertension.
- **Mechanism agent** — Queries Open Targets target-level data (GraphQL) to retrieve disease associations with evidence scores and Reactome pathway annotations.

The Supervisor first calls `find_candidates` (Open Targets competitor analysis) and `analyze_mechanism` in parallel, then delegates to the Literature and Clinical Trials agents per candidate disease.

Data sources:

- Open Targets (GraphQL) — drug targets, disease associations, competitor drugs
- ClinicalTrials.gov (REST v2) — trial search, whitespace detection, competitive landscape
- PubMed (NCBI EUtils) — literature retrieval and abstract indexing
- NCBI MeSH (E-utilities) — indication → MeSH D-number resolution for clinical-trials post-filtering
- ChEMBL — molecule metadata and ATC classifications
- openFDA — drug labels for FDA-approval extraction

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgupta/IndicationScout.git
cd IndicationScout/indication_scout
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Environment Setup

The app loads two env files in order: `.env` (secrets, DB credentials, API keys,
model names) and `.env.constants` (tunable numeric limits — top-k, timeouts,
batch sizes, etc.). `.env.constants` has **no defaults**; if a field is missing
the app fails to start. Both files must exist before running the CLI or API.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys. A checked-in
`.env.constants` provides the tunable numeric limits — leave it as-is unless
you have a reason to change a limit.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

To swap the constants file at runtime (e.g. for tests or experiments):

```bash
CONSTANTS_FILE=.env.constants.test pytest
CONSTANTS_FILE=.env.constants.experiment scout find -d "metformin"
```

Required environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. `postgresql+psycopg2://scout:scout@localhost:5438/scout`) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Yes | Database password |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | No | Separate PostgreSQL URL for integration tests (e.g. `postgresql+psycopg2://scout:scout@localhost:5438/scout_test`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Anthropic API key for Claude LLM calls |
| `NCBI_API_KEY` | No | NCBI API key for PubMed (increases rate limits) |
| `PUBMED_API_KEY` | No | PubMed API key (separate from NCBI key in config) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | OpenAI API key |
| `OPENFDA_API_KEY` | No | OpenFDA API key |
| `LLM_MODEL` | No | Primary LLM model (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`) |
| `SMALL_LLM_MODEL` | No | Lightweight LLM model (default: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | No | Embedding model (default: `FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023`) |

The project requires a PostgreSQL database with the `pgvector` extension for storing PubMed abstract embeddings. See `docs/rag_details.md` for the Docker setup.

### Database Setup

Start the database container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then apply migrations to both the main and test databases:

```bash
# Main database
alembic upgrade head

# Test database (used by integration tests)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://scout:<password>@localhost:5438/scout_test alembic upgrade head
```

Replace `<password>` with the value of `DB_PASSWORD` from your `.env` file.

> **Note:** After deleting Docker volumes (`docker compose down -v`), you must re-run both migration commands — the schema is not persisted.

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
scout find -d "metformin"                          # writes <drug>_<timestamp>.{md,json} to ./snapshots
scout find -d "metformin" --out-dir reports/       # custom output directory
scout find -d "metformin" --no-write               # print the markdown report to stdout
scout --help
```

#### Temporal holdout (`--date-before`)

For evaluation only, the pipeline can be run as a holdout study — restricting
every evidence query to what was knowable on or before a cutoff date:

```bash
scout find -d "semaglutide" --date-before 2022-01-01
# → snapshots/semaglutide_holdout_2022-01-01_<timestamp>.{md,json}
```

What it does:

- **PubMed**: returns only abstracts published before the cutoff.
- **ClinicalTrials.gov**: returns only trials whose `start_date` is before the
  cutoff; for trials that started pre-cutoff but completed/terminated after,
  outcome fields (`overall_status`, `why_stopped`, `completion_date`) are
  scrubbed and the trial appears with status `UNKNOWN`. The competitive
  landscape tool short-circuits empty under a cutoff.
- **FDA approvals**: looked up against a hardcoded
  [`data/drug_approvals.json`](data/drug_approvals.json) table gated on the
  cutoff. Without `--date-before`, the pipeline falls back to today's
  openFDA labels as usual. Drugs not in the table get no approval reasoning
  during a holdout (a warning is logged).

Holdout reports are written to `snapshots/holdouts/{drug}_holdout_{cutoff}_{timestamp}.{md,json}`
to keep them visually distinct from current-state runs.

Known limitations are documented in [`future.md`](future.md) — most notably,
the OpenTargets candidate list and mechanism scores remain current-state
because OT has no temporal API.

## Known Limitations

- **Abstract-only indexing**: PubMed articles without an abstract (letters, editorials, conference summaries) are excluded from the vector store and will not appear in semantic search results. Only articles with a non-empty abstract are embedded and cached.
- **Incomplete Open Targets approval data**: Open Targets does not record all approved indications for every drug. Approved indications missing from Open Targets will not be filtered from repurposing candidates and may appear as false positives. For example, tofacitinib's ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis approvals are absent from Open Targets, causing them to appear as repurposing candidates.
