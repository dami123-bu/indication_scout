# Open Targets Client — Data Contracts

**API:** Open Targets Platform GraphQL API (`https://api.platform.opentargets.org/api/v4/graphql`)
**Auth:** None required
**Cache TTL:** 5 days

The client provides two primary entry points that fetch complete data in a single call, plus convenience accessors for specific data types.

---

## Data Models

### Association

Target-disease association with per-datatype evidence breakdown.

```python
class Association(BaseModel):
    disease_id: str               # EFO identifier (e.g. "EFO_0003847")
    disease_name: str             # Human-readable (e.g. "non-alcoholic steatohepatitis")
    overall_score: float          # 0-1, headline association score
    datatype_scores: dict[str, float]  # Per-datatype breakdown:
        # - genetic_association: GWAS, gene burden
        # - somatic_mutation: cancer driver evidence
        # - known_drug: existing drug evidence
        # - affected_pathway: Reactome pathway evidence
        # - literature: text mining co-mentions
        # - animal_model: mouse phenotype data
        # - rna_expression: differential expression
    therapeutic_areas: list[str]  # Top-level categories
```

**Agent use:** High overall score + zero `known_drug` score = potential whitespace. The `datatype_scores` breakdown tells the Literature Agent where to look and the Critique Agent what evidence is missing.

---

### Pathway

Reactome pathway the target participates in.

```python
class Pathway(BaseModel):
    pathway_id: str          # Reactome ID
    pathway_name: str        # e.g. "Incretin synthesis, secretion, and inactivation"
    top_level_pathway: str   # Parent category (e.g. "Signal transduction")
```

**Agent use:** If GLP1R participates in "Regulation of lipid metabolism" and NASH is a metabolic disease, that's a mechanistic link.

---

### Interaction

Protein-protein interaction partner.

```python
class Interaction(BaseModel):
    interacting_target_id: str       # Ensembl ID of partner
    interacting_target_symbol: str   # Gene symbol
    interaction_score: float         # Confidence 0-1 (None for Reactome/Signor)
    source_database: str             # IntAct, STRING, Signor, Reactome
    biological_role: str             # e.g. "enzyme target"
    evidence_count: int              # Supporting experiments
    interaction_type: str | None     # "physical", "functional", "signalling", "enzymatic"
```

**Agent use:** If GLP1R interacts strongly with proteins implicated in fibrosis, that strengthens the NASH hypothesis even if direct evidence is thin.

---

### TissueExpression

Expression data for a single tissue.

```python
class TissueExpression(BaseModel):
    tissue_id: str                   # UBERON ID
    tissue_name: str                 # e.g. "liver", "pancreas"
    tissue_anatomical_system: str    # e.g. "digestive system"
    rna: RNAExpression
    protein: ProteinExpression

class RNAExpression(BaseModel):
    value: float     # TPM (transcripts per million)
    quantile: int    # Relative level across tissues
    unit: str        # "TPM"

class ProteinExpression(BaseModel):
    level: int                           # 0-3
    reliability: bool                    # Measurement reliability
    cell_types: list[CellTypeExpression]

class CellTypeExpression(BaseModel):
    name: str        # Cell type name
    level: int       # Expression level
    reliability: bool
```

**Agent use:** For NASH evaluation, it matters whether GLP1R is expressed in liver tissue. High expression strengthens the hypothesis; absence is a legitimate concern.

---

### MousePhenotype

Phenotype observed in mouse models.

```python
class MousePhenotype(BaseModel):
    phenotype_id: str              # MP ontology ID (e.g. "MP:0001556")
    phenotype_label: str           # e.g. "increased circulating glucose level"
    phenotype_categories: list[str]  # Top-level MP categories
    biological_models: list[BiologicalModel]

class BiologicalModel(BaseModel):
    allelic_composition: str    # e.g. "Glp1r<tm1Ddr>/Glp1r<tm1Ddr>"
    genetic_background: str     # e.g. "involves: 129S1/Sv * C57BL/6"
    literature: list[str]       # PMIDs
    model_id: str               # MGI identifier
```

**Agent use:** If GLP1R knockout mice show liver-related phenotypes, that's direct animal model evidence. PMIDs bridge to PubMed for full paper retrieval.

---

### SafetyLiability

Known target safety effect from Open Targets.

```python
class SafetyLiability(BaseModel):
    event: str | None          # Safety event description
    event_id: str | None       # Event identifier
    effects: list[SafetyEffect]
    datasource: str | None     # Source of the data
    literature: str | None     # Literature reference
    url: str | None

class SafetyEffect(BaseModel):
    direction: str             # Effect direction
    dosing: str | None         # Dosing conditions
```

---

### GeneticConstraint

GnomAD loss-of-function intolerance score.

```python
class GeneticConstraint(BaseModel):
    constraint_type: str       # "syn" (synonymous), "mis" (missense), "lof" (loss-of-function)
    oe: float | None           # Observed/expected ratio (lower = more constrained)
    oe_lower: float | None     # Lower CI bound
    oe_upper: float | None     # Upper CI bound
    score: float | None        # Constraint score
    upper_bin: int | None      # 0 = most constrained, 5 = least
```

**Agent use:** A highly constrained gene (low OE, low bin) suggests inhibiting it could have dangerous effects. The Critique Agent can flag: "GLP1R is moderately constrained (LOF OE = 0.35)."

---

### AdverseEvent

Significant adverse event from FAERS for a drug.

```python
class AdverseEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str                      # Adverse event term (e.g. "pancreatitis")
    meddra_code: str | None        # MedDRA identifier
    count: int                     # FAERS report count
    log_likelihood_ratio: float    # Statistical significance (higher = more significant)
```

**Agent use:** FAERS adverse events help identify class-level safety concerns.

---

### DrugSummary

A drug known to act on a target, with indication and phase info.

```python
class DrugSummary(BaseModel):
    drug_id: str                   # ChEMBL ID
    drug_name: str
    disease_id: str                # Indication EFO ID
    disease_name: str
    phase: float                   # Clinical phase (0-4)
    status: str | None             # e.g. "Active", "Completed", "Terminated"
    mechanism_of_action: str
    clinical_trial_ids: list[str]  # NCT IDs (bridge to ClinicalTrials.gov)
```

**Agent use:** If three GLP-1 agonists are in Phase 3 for NASH, that's both validation (biology works) and a competitive concern.

---

### DrugData

Everything Open Targets knows about a drug.

```python
class DrugData(BaseModel):
    chembl_id: str
    name: str
    synonyms: list[str] = []
    trade_names: list[str] = []
    drug_type: str

    @property
    def investigated_disease_ids(self) -> set[str]
```

## Agent-to-Method Mapping

| Agent | Methods consumed | What it gets |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Biology** | `get_target_data` | Disease associations, pathways, PPIs, tissue expression, mouse phenotypes |
| **Landscape** | `get_target_data`, `get_drug_indications`, `get_disease_drugs` | Known drugs for target, full drug indications pipeline, disease drug landscape |
| **Critique** | `get_target_data`, `get_drug` | Association gaps, phenotype gaps, safety liabilities, genetic constraint, drug warnings, adverse events |
| **Supervisor** | `get_drug` (entry point) | Drug resolution, approved indications for filtering, dispatches target_ids to other agents |

---

## Caching

Both `get_drug` and `get_target_data` use a two-level cache:
1. **In-memory cache** — keyed by `chembl_id` or `target_id` for fast repeated access
2. **Disk cache** — 5-day TTL, survives process restarts

The convenience accessors all call `get_target_data` internally, so accessing multiple data types for the same target only hits the API once.

---

## Example Usage

```python
client = OpenTargetsClient()

# Get drug data
drug = await client.get_drug("semaglutide")
print(f"ChEMBL ID: {drug.chembl_id}")
print(f"Targets: {[t.target_symbol for t in drug.targets]}")

# Get target data for each target
for target in drug.targets:
    target_data = await client.get_target_data(target.target_id)

    # Or use convenience accessors
    associations = await client.get_target_data_associations(target.target_id, min_score=0.5)
    expressions = await client.get_target_data_tissue_expression(target.target_id)
    phenotypes = await client.get_target_data_mouse_phenotypes(target.target_id)
    safety = await client.get_target_data_safety_liabilities(target.target_id)
    constraints = await client.get_target_data_genetic_constraints(target.target_id)

# Drug-specific accessor
indications = await client.get_drug_indications("semaglutide")

# Disease-specific accessor
disease_drugs = await client.get_disease_drugs("EFO_0003847")  # NASH
```
