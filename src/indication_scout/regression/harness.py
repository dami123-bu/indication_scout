"""Compare a golden SupervisorOutput snapshot to a current one.

Produces a list of `Diff` records. Pure function — no I/O, no network, no LLM.
Callable from both the regression test and the `scout diff-report` CLI.

Snapshot boundary is "final + per-agent": the SupervisorOutput already nests
LiteratureOutput, ClinicalTrialsOutput, and MechanismOutput under
disease_findings / mechanism, so one Pydantic dump captures everything.
