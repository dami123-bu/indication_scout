    Returns 'LoF-driven' / 'GoF-driven' / 'inconclusive' / 'unknown'. Inconclusive when records disagree;
    unknown when either field is empty.

    Disease direction terminology
    -----------------------------
    `LoF-driven` and `GoF-driven` describe the direction of target perturbation that CAUSES the disease.

      LoF-driven: the disease is caused by loss of function of the target — when the target's activity
      goes down, the disease appears or gets worse. To treat it, you want to restore target activity →
      use a GoF drug (agonist/activator). Example: a tumor suppressor gene that loses function → cancer.

      GoF-driven: the disease is caused by gain of function of the target — when the target's activity
      goes up, the disease appears or gets worse. To treat it, you want to suppress target activity →
      use an LoF drug (inhibitor/antagonist). Example: a kinase that becomes hyperactive → drives cell
      proliferation.

    The label is derived from the two evidence-record fields:

      direction_on_target | direction_on_trait | meaning                                       | label
      --------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------
      LoF                 | risk               | losing target activity → causes disease       | LoF-driven
      GoF                 | risk               | gaining target activity → causes disease      | GoF-driven
      LoF                 | protect            | losing protects ⇒ having it drives disease    | GoF-driven
      GoF                 | protect            | gaining protects ⇒ losing it drives disease   | LoF-driven

    The `protect` rows flip the inference — if losing the target protects you from disease, then the
    disease must be driven by the target being active (GoF-driven), and vice versa.

    Why this matters for classify_positive: a drug is a good candidate only when its direction opposes
    the disease-driving direction. LoF-driven disease → needs a GoF drug. GoF-driven disease → needs an
    LoF drug.

    Examples:
        >>> _disease_direction({"LoF"}, {"risk"})
        'LoF-driven'
        >>> _disease_direction({"GoF"}, {"risk"})
        'GoF-driven'
