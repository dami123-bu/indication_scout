"""Hierarchical LLM dedup pass for candidate diseases.

The supervisor's `merge_and_dedup()` step calls `run_hierarchical_dedup` after the
deterministic exact-match passes (ID match, name match, OT name-resolve). The LLM
sees the full merged candidate list and identifies super/subtype pairs that the
exact-match passes can't catch (e.g. "ulcerative colitis" ⊂ "inflammatory bowel
disease"; "type 2 diabetes mellitus" ⊂ "diabetes mellitus").

For each hierarchical pair, the LLM picks ONE survivor based on which level is most
actionable for the drug's mechanism. Failure modes — LLM error, unparseable JSON,
references to unknown survivors — log a WARNING and yield zero decisions. The
caller keeps all candidates on failure (error by omission, not inaccuracy).

diseases below and decide which single entry to KEEP per overlap. Return
decisions so a downstream filter can drop the rest.

Drug under analysis: {drug_name!r}
Drug mechanism targets: {target_str}

Candidate list (each line is one entry):
{rows}

Rules:
- A "hierarchical overlap" is any pair where one entry is a clinical SUBTYPE of
  another (e.g. ulcerative colitis ⊂ inflammatory bowel disease; type 2
  diabetes mellitus ⊂ diabetes mellitus; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ⊂
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).
- Synonyms (NAFLD ↔ non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) are also overlaps and
  should produce one decision picking either spelling.
- DO NOT group sibling diseases (two distinct subtypes of the same parent) —
  only true super/subtype relationships.
- HARD RULE: every entry in a decision's `dropped` list MUST be either a
  super/subtype or a synonym of that decision's `survivor`. Never put a
  sibling, cousin, or otherwise unrelated entry in `dropped`, even if the
  entry seems clinically irrelevant to the drug's mechanism. Clinical
  relevance is NOT your concern here — this step ONLY removes redundant
  hierarchical overlaps. A different downstream step filters by relevance.
  Example: with candidates {{diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
  type 1 diabetes mellitus}}, the ONLY valid decision is
  {{survivor: "type 2 diabetes mellitus" OR "diabetes mellitus",
   dropped: [the other one]}}. T1DM is a SIBLING of T2DM and MUST be left
  alone, regardless of how poorly it fits the drug.
- For each overlap, pick the ONE survivor. DEFAULT: prefer the SUBTYPE — it is
  more actionable as a repurposing candidate than its parent. The parent only
  wins when the subtype is itself an approved/standard indication for this
  drug (so dropping it removes a non-opportunity) AND the parent has a
  clinically distinct uncovered population not subsumed by the subtype.
  Heuristics:
    * Default: keep the subtype, drop the parent. Broad parent terms like
      "metabolic disease", "cancer", "autoimmune disease" are rarely useful
      as repurposing candidates and should lose to any specific child.
    * Exception: if the subtype IS the drug's approved indication (e.g.
      type 2 diabetes for metformin) AND the parent encompasses additional
      uncovered populations, prefer the parent.
    * For synonyms (NAFLD ↔ non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), either
      spelling is fine — pick the more clinically standard form.
    * Source tag is informative but not decisive: "both" entries are slightly
      preferred (they had independent support) but can still be dropped if
      another entry is the better match.
- One decision per overlap. Do not produce decisions that don't drop anyone.
- Use the EXACT canonical names shown in the candidate list above (do not
  reword, abbreviate, or add/remove articles).

Return a single JSON object:

{{"decisions": [
  {{"survivor": "<canonical name>",
    "dropped": ["<canonical name>", ...],
    "reason": "<short clinical reason, log-only>"}}
]}}

If there are NO hierarchical overlaps, return {{"decisions": []}}.

Return only the JSON object. Do not include any other text.
