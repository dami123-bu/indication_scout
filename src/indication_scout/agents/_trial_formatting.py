"""Shared formatters for rendering Trial data into LLM-visible content strings.

Both the clinical_trials sub-agent's tools and the supervisor's
`analyze_clinical_trials` tool use these helpers. The point of centralizing them is
to keep the prompt-side contract consistent across both layers — see
`agent_data_contracts.md` at the project root for the spec.

Background: the clinical-trials tools use
`@tool(response_format="content_and_artifact")`. LangChain serializes only the
`content` string into the API payload; the typed Pydantic artifact stays
Python-side and is invisible to the model. So whatever the LLM is going to
reason over has to be in the content string. These helpers build that string.
