"""Date-bounded literature signals for trial-risk features.

For each trial, we ask three questions of the PubMed corpus *as it stood
LOOKBACK_MONTHS before the trial's completion_date*:

  - failure_signal:  how strongly does the literature talk about failure /
                     termination / discontinuation of this drug for this disease?
  - safety_signal:   how strongly does it talk about safety / adverse events /
                     toxicity?
  - efficacy_signal: how strongly does it talk about efficacy / response /
                     positive outcomes?

Each signal is the mean cosine similarity of the top-k semantic-search hits
restricted to PMIDs whose `pub_date < cutoff_date`.

Reuses `services.retrieval.RetrievalService` for fetch+cache and
`services.embeddings.embed_async` for query embeddings. No new external calls
beyond what RetrievalService already does.
