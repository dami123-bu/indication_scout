Each test exercises a different INFERENCE branch and asserts both on the
structural artifacts (deterministic — produced by tools) and on the summary
content (LLM-generated — asserted with robust substring/regex checks that
reflect prompt rules rather than specific phrasings).

Hits real ClinicalTrials.gov, openFDA, ChEMBL, NCBI, and Anthropic APIs.
